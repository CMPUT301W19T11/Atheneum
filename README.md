## Running UI Tests

To run the UI Tests go to C:\Users\ishaa\Projects\Atheneum\app\src\androidTest\java\com\example\atheneum\activities\AtheneumTestSuite.java
in Android Studio and click run.

Do not try to run the tests outside of the test suite since the tests require a test user to be
loggedin. Running the test suite ensures that the tests are run in order.
